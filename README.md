This repository contains the code to run a force-feedback glove in VR. The glove allows users to interact with objects in VR and feel like they are actually toucking the object with their hand.

Environments used: mbed and Unity

Languages used: arduino, C++ and C#. 

Inertial Measurment Units (IMUs), measuring linear and angular acceleration were used to capture finger rotation, while an HTC Vive tracker was used to capture the position of the arm in space.

An electroadhisive clutch was used to provide a breaking force on the finger and thus provide force feedback to the user.
